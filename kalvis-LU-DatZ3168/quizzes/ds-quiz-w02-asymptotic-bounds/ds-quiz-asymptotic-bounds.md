# DS Quiz 2A, Asymptotic Bounds

**Question 1:**

What is the number of digits in :math:`2^{100}`? 

**Question 2:** 

What is the approximate factor -- how the number length grows or shrinks as it is rewritten from decimal into binary?

**Question 3:**

Find the following limit: 

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \log_{10} \frac{a_4 n^4 + a_3 n^3 + a_2 n^2 + a_1 n + a_0}{b_3 n^3 + b_2 n^2 + b_1 n + b_0}.$$




# Answers


**Question 1:** 

Answer: `b`  

In (a) grouping $\neg (B \wedge C)$ is terribly wrong, 
since negation has the highest precedence, it only applies to $B$.

In (c) there are redundant parentheses at the very end (but this expression computes a correct expression).
