Written Assignment06
=======================

Look up your Student ID. 
Write down the last three digits of this Student ID, denote these digits by :math:`a,b,c`. 


**Question:**
  Define a new integer number :math:`N \in \{0,1,2,\ldots,9 \}` from the digits of your Student ID: 
  
  .. math:: 
  
    N \;=\; (a + b) \;\text{mod}\; 10.

  
  **(A)** 
    Redraw the binary tree in Figure; 
    replace letters :math:`a,b` with your values. We denote this tree by :math:`B`. 

  **(B)** 
    List all the nodes of :math:`B` in their in-order DFS traversal order. 

  **(C)** 
    Draw a general tree (denoted by :math:`G`) that is obtained
    by decoding the tree :math:`B`.
    See `Encoding general trees as binary trees <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Encoding_general_trees_as_binary_trees>`_ 
    or `<https://bit.ly/3kdyg8n>`_.

  **(D)** 
    What is the depth of the node with number :math:`N` (defined above) in the new tree :math:`G`?
