Walk-Through 4: CMake and DLLs
===============================

Build projects as several libraries and other parts that depend on them. 


Objective
---------

Build and run C++ code with CMake on Windows and Linux. Build DLLs (and also static libs) and use them in other projects.


Overview of Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Step 1** 
  Try out the CMake tool: Command-line ``cmake`` on a Windows or Linux machine.
  
**Step 2**
  Build shared libraries: Use ``cmake`` to create DLLs (dynamic link libraries on Windows) or SO (shared objects on Linux).

**Step 3**  
  Use the shared libraries: Create another project using the includes and libraries from an earlier one.
