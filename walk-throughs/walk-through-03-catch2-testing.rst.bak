Walk-Through 3: Test-Driven Development with Catch2
====================================================

In this walk-through we have a class definition using an UML diagram
and requirements for its methods. We create method stubs and testcases 
using the Catch2 framework. After that the methods are completed to satisfy 
the testcases. 


Objective
---------

UML diagrams are a common way to represent class design graphically. 
To ensure an orderly object-oriented coding we can stick to the design closely and
do testcases before the code itself is written. This approach is named 
test-driven development; it uses the encapsulation of objects in object-oriented 
programming. 



Overview of Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Step 1** 
  Convert a UML diagram into method stubs: Use the given UML diagram in order to create class prototype with 
  method stubs. 
  
**Step 2**
  Use Catch2 as a unit testing framework: Code testcases with asserts of class method behavior. 

**Step 3**  
  Use Catch2 to test exception behavior: Test user-defined exceptions and behaviors intended to cause them. 
  
**Step 4**
  Use Catch2 for setup and teardown: Surround testcases with setup and teardown routines. 
  Measure the time for a single test and also the total time for tests.
  
**Step 5** 
  Run testing reports: Inspect reports as plaintext or HTML files.
  
**Step 6**
  Run time-limited system test (kill the process after 1 second or similar).
