Written Assignment05
=======================

Before doing this task, look up your Student ID. 
Write down the last three digits of this Student ID, denote these digits by :math:`a,b,c`. 
For example, if Student ID is ``201RDB789``, then :math:`a = 7`, :math:`b = 8`, :math:`c = 9`.

Parameters :math:`a,b,c` should be replaced in the problem below. 


**Question:**
  Consider the following zero-based array: 
  
  .. math::
  
    \{ 9, 23, 31, 35, 43, 61, 69, 49, 41, 53, 67, 75 \}
	
  This array is used to store a minimum heap.
	  
  **(A)** 
    Draw this heap as a binary tree.
  
  **(B)** 
    Draw another tree showing the state of this heap after inserting :math:`10\cdot a + 2(b + c)`. 
    (Replace :math:`a,b,c` with the last three digits from your Student ID.)
  
  **(C)** 
    Show what is the state of a heap after you remove the minimum from the heap obtained after step **(B)**.
    (If you need to make "downheap" operation for a node :math:`a` that is larger than both of its 
    children :math:`b` and :math:`c`, then exchange :math:`a` with its left child whenever you have a choice 
    between both sides.)
