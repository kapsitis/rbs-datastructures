**Question 1:**

  (*1.A. Given a list/stack/queue algorithm pseudocode, find its time complexity.*)
  
  Consider the following List ADT (Abstract Data Type): 
  
  =============================   =============================================================
  `void L.add(E item)`            // add `item` to the end of the list `L`.
  `void L.add(int pos, E item)`	  // add `item` at position `pos`; shift other items forward.
  `boolean L.contains(E item)`    // return ``true`` iff the item is in the list `L`
  `int L.size()`                  // return the number of items in the list `L`
  `boolean L.isEmpty()`           // return ``true`` iff the list is empty
  `E L.get(int pos)`              // return the item at position pos in the List
  `E L.remove(int pos)`           // remove and return the item at position pos in the List
  =============================   =============================================================

  Consider the following pseudocode  -- it erases all the odd elements and reverses the remaining list: 
  
  | function `ModifyList(L: List[int])`: 
  | `pos` := :math:`0`
  | **while** `pos < L.size()`: 
  |     **if** `L.get(pos) % 2 == 1`:
  |         `L.remove(pos)`
  |     **else**: 
  |         `pos := pos+1`
  | `n` := `L.size()`
  | **for** `i` **from** :math:`n-1` **to** `0` **by** `-1`:
  |     `item := L.get(i)`
  |     `L.add(item)`
  | **repeat** `n` **times**:
  |     `L.remove(0)`
  
  
  What is the worst-case time complexity of the three loops 
  (**while**, **for** and **repeat**) in the function `ModifyList(L)`. 
  Express the complexity in terms of :math:`n` (the size of the original list :math:`L`)? 
  Consider two cases: 
  
  **(A)** 
    Assume that the List ADT is implemented as a doubly linked list
    with the pointers to the first and the last element
    and an additional number ``size`` telling the current number of items -- 
    the number of nodes in this linked list.

  **(B)**
    Assume that the List ADT is implemented as an array (assume that the array has enough space for any possible input)
    and an additional number ``size`` telling the current number of items (namely, 
    only the array elements from 0 to ``size - 1`` contain actual values, everything else in 
    the array should be ignored). 
  

  **Answer:** 
  
  **(A)**
  
    **while** takes :math:`O(n^2)`, **for** takes :math:`O(n^2)`, **repeat** takes :math:`O(n)` steps. 
	
    Indeed, if no item in the list is odd, then ``pos`` is incremented
    every time in the **while** loop. And then the calls 
    to ``L.get(pos)`` become slower every time. 
    (Unfortunately, the ADT methods ``L.get()`` cannot use iterator (or pointer to the linked list
    nodes -- the implementation of list is encapsulated and hidden from the user). Using 
    linked list explicitly, it can be traversed in :math:`O(n)` -- in linear time (and it is possible
    to remove all the odd elements as well). 
	
    **for** loop also takes :math:`O(n^2)` as you need to travel :math`n-1`, then :math:`n-2` steps, 
    and so on. (Once again, you cannot benefit from the links in the linked list as the ADT methods
    do not exposse any internal pointers). 
	
    **repeat** loop (removing the first element :math:`n` times) takes :math:`O(n)` steps. 
    In this case no need to traverse the linked list. 
	
  **(B)** 

    **while** takes :math:`O(n^2)`, **for** takes :math:`O(n)`, **repeat** takes :math:`O(n^2)` steps. 
    
    Once again **while** loop can take quadratic time, but this time the worst case happens, if
    there are many odd elements that need to be removed (and all the array elements to the right need to be shifted 
    to the left). For example, if every second element is odd, we would still get :math:`O(n^2)` steps.

    **for** loop takes :math:`O(n)` as it is possible to access every item at position ``pos`` directly 
    in a single step. It is also easy to add it to the end of the list (and increment :math:`size`). 
	
    **repeat** loop takes :math:`O(n^2)` as one hs to shift the elements to the left many times. 
	
  .. note::
    The algorithmic task (remove odd elements and reverse the list) can be done in :math:`O(n)` steps -- 
    all three loops can become efficient, if we keep using using  the doubly linked list implementation. 
	
    In this case one needs additional ADT methods (for example, an iterator allowing 
    to traverse the given list in both directions). Such operations are efficient in a linked list, 
    if we do not require that the cursor (for reading or deletion) 
    moves to ``pos`` from the beginning of the list every time.

**Question 2:**
  
  (*2.A. Given some tree properties and element counts, calculate or estimate other counts.*)

  Consider a tree :math:`T` with the following properties: 
  
  * :math:`T` has exactly :math:`12` internal nodes, 
  * Every internal node of :math:`T` has one or two children. 
  * The average number of children for an internal node is exactly :math:`1.5`. 
  * Tree :math:`T` is built from ``TNode`` structures:
  
  .. code-block:: cpp
  
    struct TNode { int info; TNode* left; TNode* right; };
  
  **(A)**
    What is the number of leaves in tree :math:`T`?

  **(B)**
    What is the number of ``NULL`` values among all the ``TNode.left`` and ``TNode.right`` pointers
    used to build the tree :math:`T`?
	
  **(C)**
    What is the largest and the smallest value of the height of the tree :math:`T`. 
    (Write your estimates for minimum height and maximum height, and explain why these
    estimates cannot be improved.)
	
  .. note::
    We define *height* of a tree as the number of edges to traverse on the path that connects its
    root with the deepmost leaf. (In particular, a tree with just the root node has height 0, 
    but a tree with the root and a single child leaf has height 1.) 
    

  **Answer:** (A) 7, (B) 20, (C) 4 (min) and 12 (max).

  **(A)**
    Out of 12 internal nodes there must be exactly :math:`6` nodes with two children 
    and :math:`6` nodes with one child each (to achieve the average :math:`1.5`). 
    A tree without two-child nodes would have just one "branch" that is terminated by a leaf. 
    Each internal node having two children increases the number of downgoing "branches" by one, 
    so it increases the number of leaves by one as well. 
    Consequently, six two-child nodes cause seven leaves. 
	
  **(B)**
    The total number of nodes (both internal and leaves) is :math:`12 + 7 = 19`. 
    Consider another tree which is a full binary tree -- it adds all the ``NULL`` pointers
    as new leaves; in this case all the former nodes (internal and leaves) become internal nodes. 
	
    One can prove by induction that the number of leaves exceeds the number of 
    internal nodes exactly by 1 (Drozdek 2013, p.217).  
    So there must be exactly :math:`19 + 1 = 20` leaves in the new tree (corresponding to the ``NULL`` pointers).
	
  **(C)**
    The smallest height can be achieved locating all the six nodes with two children in the upper three levels
    (its height is 4). The largest heigth can be achieved by arranging the internal nodes 
    of a binary tree one under another (its height is 12). 
	
    .. figure:: figs/extreme-trees.png
       :width: 3in
       :alt: Minimum height and maximum height
	   
       Trees with the minimum height (4) and the maximum height (12).
	
    It is impossible to improve these estimates: Any tree with height three cannot have more nodes than 
    the perfect tree of height three -- it has just :math:`7` internal nodes (not :math:`12` as in our case). 
    Also, no tree with :math:`12` internal nodes can be taller than :math:`12` (at most one 
    level is added with every internal node). 
	
  .. note:: 
    Both trees of "extremal" height (as well as all the other binary tree satisfying the conditions of 
    this problem) have the same number of leaves and the same number of ``NULL`` pointers -- 
    they are *invariants* of any binary tree with the given parameters.

**Question 3:**

  (*3.A. Perform insert and delete operations in an arbitrary binary search tree.*)

  .. image:: figs/bst-tree.png
     :width: 5in

  **(A)**
    Draw the Binary Search tree obtained when the tree shown in figure has its node :math:`47` deleted. 
	
  **(B)**
    Draw the Binary Search tree obtained when the tree from (A) has its node :math:`26` deleted. 

  :note:
    To avoid ambiguity, try to replace the node to be deleted with its inorder successor whenever 
    it is possible. (You do not need to balance the resulting tree as an AVL or as a red-black tree 
    -- as long as it stays a binary search tree and preserves the tree ordering property.) 
	

  **Answer:** 
  
  **(A)**
    Since :math:`47` is the very last node (in the given ordering), this is precisely the 
    case when it does not have an inorder successor (so it has to be replaced by its inorder
    predecessor, namely the node :math:`45`. (In this case the node :math:`44` becomes the right
    child of :math:`43`). 
	

  **(B)**
    The root :math:`26` should be replaced by its inorder successor -- the node :math:`28`.
	
  Pictures are not shown, but you are encouraged to draw them.

  :math:`\square`  
	
	
	






**Question 6:** 

  (*6.C. (C++ code) Use STL classes for priority queue operations.*)

  Create a C++ program that reads from the standard input a positive integer :math:`n`, 
  and then exactly :math:`n` space-separated integers. 
  It should output the median of these integers to the standard output as a real number.
  Use ``std::priority_queue`` to find the median.
  (You can assume that the program will receive data that matches this 
  description and you do not need to handle erroneous input.)
  
  .. note:: 
    Recall that the *median* of a collection of :math:`n` numbers :math:`a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n` is 
    the middle number in the sorted order of :math:`a_i` (if :math:`n` is odd), or the arithmetic
    mean of the two middle numbers in the sorted order of :math:`a_i` (if :math:`n` is even). 

  **Answer:** 
    The solution is given below. We build a maximum heap using default comparator (since it is median, the sorting
    direction does not matter; it could also be a minimum heap). 
    Operation ``pop()`` removes the maximum element, but ``top()`` returns the maximum without modifying the queue.
