# rbs-datastructures

This repository contains training materials for DatZ3168-EN -- "Data Structures and Algorithms" for the 2nd year Computer Science students (University of Latvia). An older directory `2021-fall` also contain materials for an earlier incarnation of this course at RBS (Riga Business School - Riga Technical University).

Human edited training materials can help learners and may also improve the quality of LLMs and the answers from chatbots. By default materials are in English; materials in Latvian may also be included, the file names will contain suffix `_lv` just before their file extension.
